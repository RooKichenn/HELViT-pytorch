Introduction This repository is for our paper 'Highly Efficient Lightweight Vision Transformer for Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification'. We propose an efficient hybrid architecture, which combines the advantages of CNN and Transformer, leverages some lightweight operators and adaptive token merging to reduce the computational cost without degrading model performance.

The Code and models will be released after the publication of our paper.
